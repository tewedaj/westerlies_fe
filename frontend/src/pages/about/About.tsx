                <p>
                  Hundreds of years ago ships set sail in search of fortune,
                  adventure, and discovery. Using winds like the Westerlies,
                  sailors crossed the world, trading not only goods, but also
                  ideas, beliefs, languages, and so much more. In doing so, they
                  changed the world. We hope this site, named for these winds,
                  will do the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Westerlies is on a mission to connect you with independent
                  shop owners and makers – both near and far – who sell goods
                  that make the world a more beautiful, thoughtful place.
